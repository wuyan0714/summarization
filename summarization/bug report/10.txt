 Open a new image,
 create a layer much bigger than the image, and with a different aspect ratio.
 draw something on the drawable (using some colors)
 make a selection selecting only some parts of your drawing
 use the channel mixer.
 The selection looks wrong in the plugin, and the plugin can even crash.
 This is due to the fact that the selection mask is taken with gimp_drawable_get_thumbnail_data () in the preview code.
 So if the layer and the image have different size, they are streched differently.
 Clearly what it is doing is bad, but what *should* it be doing?  
 Should the preview follow the shape of the selection bounds, the image, or the drawable?
 On a big image, use crop tool on right, bottom or right bottom, click on resize.
 The active picture is then little than the layer.
 Using any tool with preview give a one pixel (or less ;) ) preview instead of the good one.
 Compute intersection between layer and active picture could be the solution...
 As far as I can see, there are two reasonable options, and either of them will require a substantial amount of fixing in the aspect preview code and the plugins that use it.  
 (1) Show the entire drawable in an aspect preview, and mask changes using the current selection.
 (2) Show only the part of the drawable lying within the selection bounds. 
 It isn't clear to me which of them is better.
 Bumping to 2.4 since this is not likely to get fixed for 2.2
 Bumping to Future since this is not likely to get fixed for 2.4.
 Setting back to the 2.4 milestone since it's a crash and should, if possible, be looked at before the 2.4 release.
 Fixing this might make API changes necessary. 
 We need to look into this as soon as possible.
 It would help a lot if someone could attach an example XCF file to this bug report that shows the problem.

 bug156905.xcf.bz2 - a layer bigger than image
 Following assertion failed using Channel mixer on the layer.
 (channel_mixer:6701): LibGimpWidgets-CRITICAL **: gimp_preview_area_mask: assertion `mask != NULL' failed
 Doesn't channel mixer use GimpZoomPreview (not GimpAspectPreview)?
 Seems like both GimpZoomPreview and GimpAspectPreview have problems when steps in reporter's comment are taken.
 This one is nasty to track down.
 The example image has dimensions 377*233, the selection starts at x=125, y=97 and extends to the lower right corner of the image.
 The preview code then calls gimp_drawable_get_sub_thumbnail on the selection mask with the following coordinates:
   src_x: 117, src_y: 89, src_w: 268, src_h: 152
 which unsurprisingly fails, since src_x+src_w is bigger than the selection mask width.
 The source coordinates seem wrong to me and originate from gimp_zoom_preview_get_source_area(), but I have not yet tracked this down.

 GimpZoomPreview handle layer offsets
 This patch should fix GimpZoomPreview to handle layers with offsets with selections. 
 Area displayed in preview is intersection of layer and selection.
 If there are no objections, I could commit the patch.
 For GimpAspectPreview selection mask has to be applied for thumbnail of the whole drawable (selection can intersect partialy with drawable area).
 Please commit this. 
 It doesn't make sense to patch 2 [details].4 at this point. 
 So please do this in trunk only.
