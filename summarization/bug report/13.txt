 Please describe the problem:
 When going to File-&gt;Acquire-&gt;Screenshot in the Windows port of the development build GIMP 2.3.11, firstly there are two different entries \"Screen Shot\" and \"Screenshot\" and secondly, functionality to grab only a portion of the screen is broken.
 There is no option to \"Select a Region to Grab\" when the user chooses \"Screen Shot.\"
 However, this option exists in the dialogue box that appears after the user selects :Screenshot.\" 
 However, the functionality does not work, even after selecting a long delay period.
 Instead, the whole screen is captured each time.  
 I was expecting the mouse cursor onscreen to change to \"crosshairs\" or something similar to allow me to select the region I required.
 Steps to reproduce:
 1. Launch GIMP 2.3.11 Development for Windows on a Windows 2000 platform.
 2. Got o File-&gt;Acquire-&gt;Screenshot.  (Note the two different entries for \"Screen Shot\" and \"Screenshot\".)
 3. Tick \"Select a Region to Grab.\"  
 4.  Set the delay.
 5.  Click \"Grab.\"
 Actual results:
 The whole screen is captured each time.
 Expected results:
 The ability to select a portion of the screen would be available, probably via mouse click-and-drag functionality.
 Does this happen every time?
 Yes.
 Other information:
 (I presume the two entries for screenshots under the submenu are there in order to test old and new code, by the way but I just noted it in case there was an issue.)

 We know that the port of the screenshot plug-in for Windows is incomplete.
 What's this bug-report about? 
 Do you want to contribute the missing bits or do you want us to disable the plug-in for the Windows platform? 
 We are waiting for a volunteer to implement the missing functionality for more than a year now.
 Perhaps it's about time to drop support for the Win32 platform completely.
 Sven,
 The bug report was to alert you in case you did not know it was broken.  
 You are obviously aware it is incomplete.  
 Perhaps you should disable it to prevent more questions from users.
 I am not a programmer so I cannot implement the functionality.  
 I am trying to do my part by reporting issues for you.
 You have complained before about how short of volunteers you are.  
 If this is the case, perhaps it is a very good idea to drop support for Win32 and consolidate on making sure the *Nix implementation is as good as possible. 
 Supporting Win32 is probably just draining more resources away.
 IIRC Tor is working on this.
 apf, you are using a development version. 
 Of course there are incomplete and even broken features in there. 
 If you are just a user, you should be using the stable release.
 Tor said that it is impossible to implement the look and feel of the X11 screenshot plug-in on the Windows platform. 
 He suggested that we stick with Winsnap for the Win32.

     * plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: reverted changes from 2006-04-06 and build screenshot plug-in optionally again. 
 Fixes bug #364852.
     * plug-ins/common/mkgen.pl: reverted addition of 'extralibs' parameter that was introduced for the screenshot plug-in only.
