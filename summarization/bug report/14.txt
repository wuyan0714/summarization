 Please describe the problem:
 When I try to export reports that contain graphs gnuCash just creates an empty html file.
 Also it is not clear that the export can only do html files. 
 The first time I ran export I triped to save as .jpg and it created a html file named foo.jpg
 Steps to reproduce:
 1. In gnuCash go on reports and create any report that contains a graph
 2. In the report window click on Export 
 3. Save export to \"foo.html\"
 Actual results:
 An empty HTML file is saved
 Expected results:
 A HTML file with a nice graph 
 Does this happen every time?
 Yes
 Other information:
 Yes, that's true -- the current graphing code, which uses the graphical library \"Guppi\" which is a dead project, can only produce the on-screen diagrams *and* print these to postscript, but it cannot export these diagrams into pictures that are embedded in a HTML-file. 
 In other words, you can only print the diagrams to postscript but not export them to HTML. 
 This is not going to change before the gnome2 port is completed, because we need to switch to a different graphical library before anything related to this can be changed. 
 See http://gnomesupport.org/wiki/index.php/GnuCashPortingStatus for the porting status.
 Definitely keep it as a reminder.
 We should be able to coax anything into giving us a PNG; GOG supports SVG export, too.  
 But it looks like gtkhtml doesn't support saving &lt;object /&gt; data.
 Because it sucks ass.
 This is still valid for me with version 2.0.4 on opensuse 10.2. 
 This is a real problem not to be able to export these reports. 
 This shouldn't be tagged 'enhancement' anymore, but brought up higher.
 What's the status on this? 
 Thank you.

 There's no change on this.
 I wonder if the more recent gtkhtml supports getting at &lt;object /&gt;s, or if the more recent GOG makes it trivial to create a PNG.
 In any case, I hesitate to do so, but I've raised the severity to Normal -- a minor part of the component (Reports, export, graphs) does not work.
 (FWIW, Fred, it's not going to get fixed any faster at Normal than at Enhancement.)
 I can confirm this using GnuCash 2.0.5 on Ubuntu 7.04, feisty fawn...and I can confirm that it's frustrating....
 2.2.8, still doesn't have this needed feature... Frustration also confirmed.
 GtkHtml provides a callback when it encounters a &lt;object&gt; tag, and gnc-html then calls gog to create the image as a GdkPixbuf and then embed it in the web page.  
 For the webkit port, there is no &lt;object&gt; callback.  
 Therefore, gnc-html-webkit pre-parses the html string, finds the &lt;object&gt; tag, calls gog with the parameter values from the &lt;object&gt; to create a GdkPixbuf, then converts the pixels to png/base64 and embeds the html &lt;img&gt; in the original
 where the &lt;object&gt; was.  
 Result is a graph that displays in webkit.  
 In addition, gnc-html-webkit saves the html passed to webkit and handles the export itself by writing that html to a file.
 This fix is targetted for 2.4.  
 I can also convert gnc-html-gtkhtml to use these two features (convert graph to embedded &lt;img&gt; and do the export rather
 than getting gtkhtml to do it) for those who can't build 2.4 with webkit.
 It turns out that gtkhtml (at least the version I have on Ubuntu 9.04) doesn't support inline images.  
 Therefore, this will only be possible using webkit.
 The gnucash-1.8.x series is no longer developed. 
 We may keep this enhancement request as a reminder, though.
