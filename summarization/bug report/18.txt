 the error report
 I'm using the SWT library, ran the \"Hello World\" example:
 import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;
 public class SWTExperiment {
         public static void main (String [] args) {
                 Display display = new Display ();
                 Shell shell = new Shell(display);
                 shell.open ();
                 while (!shell.isDisposed ()) {
                         if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep ();
                 }
                 display.dispose ();
         }
 }
 and SWT fails to load, it always exits with java has exited due to signal 4 (SIGILL).
 I see the window flash open, then immediately it crashes.
 There is nothing in the logs.
 when i open the resulting jar with the jar launcher I get the crash report which I attached.
 also, I ditched the new version and tried 3.2.2 and it worked
 On my Mac, running OS X 10.5.2, I successfully ran the hello world example, from the command line, using the SWT from R3.4 M6. 
 Can you try that version and see if it fails for you? 
 Also, can you run     java -version   and let us know what it prints?
 this is the output from java -version
 java version \"1.5.0_13\"
 Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_13-b05-241)
 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_13-121, mixed mode, sharing)
 I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11, so still on Tiger.
 I ran it again with the R3.4 M6 (including swt-debug.jar) and i'm getting the same issue, seeing the frame and then crashing with SIGILL.
 Adding Steve to increase the visibility.
 How are you launching your app? 
 If you are launch from the command line, are you using the -XstartOnFirstThread option?

 I'm running on leopard w/o any problems. 
 I'll try Tiger.
 Sorry, I could not reproduce this on Tiger either. 
 I tried running in Eclipse, from command line, and exporting a project as a runnable jar from Eclipse. 
 No crashes.
 Please provide detailed instructions on how you are creating your project and running you code.
 I created it using xcode 2.5 on tiger.  
 I tried using eclipse but it would not build from source for some reason, so thats how i ended up on xcode.  
 There are no command line arguments except -cp SWTexperiment.jar SWTexperiment, which doesn't pertain to this.  
 I just tried adding the -XstartOnFirstThread option and everything worked fine.
  No crashing, everything is wonderful. 
  what does this option do?
