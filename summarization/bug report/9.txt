 Firefox currently supports a wide number of stand alone e-mail applications (including it's own Thunderbird client), when an e-mail link is clicked on in Firefox.  
 To the best of my knowledge it still does not support web based e-mail clients such as g-mail in this fashion.
 The idea is that if one prefers to use a web based e-mail account, they should have the option to configure firefox to log into that web based e-mail account and open a compose new message window.
 I understand this may require some colaboration with the popular web based e-mail services such as gmail and aim mail, but I think it would be worth the benifit.
 Reproducible: Always
 Something like the WebmailCompose extension?
 Other enhancement requests like this have been marked as dups of bug 11459, but I think that's wrong.  
 As far as I can tell, bug 11459 is a combination of a design flaw specific to Seamonkey and a tangentially related enhancement request that also applies to Firefox, and nothing is happening there.
 It's sad that mailto: links don't work for most webmail users, especially since webmail is so popular.
 Webmail services can help give users programs that alter system mailto: behavior (e.g. the unofficial \"G-Mailto\" and the official \"Gmail Notifier\"), and Firefox users can download the WebmailCompose extension, but i think it would be better if this were an option in Firefox itself.
 Not going to block on this, would be good to have this generically for feeds as well, but this may have to wait for Gecko 1.9

 Is this not now fixed?
 Indeed.
